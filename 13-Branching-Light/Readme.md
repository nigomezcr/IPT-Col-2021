# Problem 13: Branching Light

When a laser beam passes through a thin film (e.g., soap bubble film), random filaments of light are created in an effect known as *branch flow*. Explain the phenomenon. Can one design a medium to produce specific branching patterns? Can it be extended to other wave phenomena (water waves or sound waves), etc?
