# Heavy Parachute

**Problem Statement**

Is it possible to build a magnetic parachute to protect a load from impact when
landing on a non-magnetic metallic surface? How should it be built in order to
minimize the impact damage? What are the limitations of your parachute?

## Objectives:

1. Design a device that uses magnetic forces for reducing the final speed of an object
   falling in a non-magnetic metallic surface.

2. Study the parameters in order to minimize the final speed.

3. Determine limitations.

## Pathway

I'll divide the problem into some milestones anddescribe them in terms of the expected results and the tasks to be made.

### Understand the Phenomena

The first step is to have a clear understanding of the phenomena described in the video. It is based on 3 main concepts:

-   Faraday's law (electromagnetic induction)
-   Lenz' law
-   Eddy currents.

As a rough description, the idea is that the magnet falls in the conducting non magnetic surface and the changing magnetic field of the falling magnet induces a current in the conductor (Eddy currents). This current, now induces a magnetic field that opposes that of the falling magnet and thus, an upward magnetic force is excerted in the magnet slowing it down.

Now, in order to have a clear idea of this, We could explore the system through theory and experiments (Also studying the connection between the 2)

**Theory:** Develop a simple model for relating the force excerted or the final speed with different parameters from the magnet and the conductor.

The idea here is to develop the simple model that Nicolas did in the Overleaf and extend it based on what we find in the papers.

**Experimental:** After having a working theoretical model for the problem, the idea is to develop an experiment that allow us to validate the model.

> The main objective here is to develop the model that relates the parameters of the magnet and the conductor with the final speed.

Once we have a working model for the falling magnet, we could look forward to developing one for the coil and other for the bars in the sides.

### Design the parachute

With this in mind, it is now necessary to introduce a load to the model, the idea is to paste the magnet and the load in order to slowit down before the impact. As a first apporach, adding the mas of the load to the previous model should be enough.

### Minimize

Optimize the model to find which parameters are important for minimizing the final speed of the load before the impact.

### Limits

Understand the limits of the model and of the system itself. The model have limits that are based in the approximations and simplifications that we make. The limitations of the system come from the parameters, for example, the metallic plate must be a conductor.

In the other hand we have a limitation that may come from the idea of a strong magnet that leads to a force so strong as to damage the load instead of protecting it.

## Schedule

### Week 1

Minions select which papers are useful. Juan Ber reads the papers about Eddy current calculations and experiments from wikipedia references.

### Week 2

Juan Ber develop the model based on the papers selected by the Minions and they are avilable in case Juan Ber needs to talk and understand. All start designing the experiment.

### Week 3

Do the experiments and tune the model. The presentation should be taking shape.

### Week 4

Backup week because things go wrong.
