# Plant Generated Electricity 

## TO DO

- Statistics: meeting with Juanes 23.02 (at night). Code is ready.
- Biology: meeting with Melisa 24.02 (20:00 CET). Read! Hopefully pH measurements done (waiting for pH paper)
- Soil: hopefully meeting with Darwin on Friday, if not, meeting with Paola.  (Waiting Darwin's answer)
- Take photos of the setup and all the process. 

## Dead soil

- The most simple of all groups, which allows us to see mainly that humidity is a factor which indeed affects electricity.
  - Should I make an independent experiment to see more precisely the behaviour of electricity as a function of humidity? (at least for this case)

### To be answered: 

- **Basics:**
  - Which are the physical properties of the soil important for electricity conduction?

- **Effects of high temperatures in soil properties:** 
  - From a biological point of view is it correct to say that we killed all organisms in the soil? Justify
  - Which are the effects of high temperatures in physical properties of the soil? 

## Living soil

- The next step in complexity. We are measuring effects of a healthy soil and humidity.
- There is a tendency to decrease voltage over time, i.e. we are measuring a clear effect of humidity.

### To be answered:

- What is the relation between microorganisms and water? Why is voltage so high when the soil is wet (high humidity)?
  - Respiration equation 
  - Sugar (Carbon) + Minerals
- Which are the most common microorganisms in a typical soil? What are the most important processes carried out by them? Which is their relation with soil properties? What do they need for living?

## Plants exposed to light

- We can say we are measuring effects coming from:
  - Humidity 
    - **Note:** Plants light voltage and dead soil have similar voltages when both are very wet.
  - **Rhizodeposition** 
    - **Note:** Effect of rhizodeposition make up for the lost of humidity over time (compare with the Living soil group)
  - Normal light intensity
    - Plants are healthy over time 
  - Plant nutrition
    - **Note:** We can appreciate a decrease in voltage when plants are watered. 

## Plants without exposition to light

### To be answered:

- Which are the effects of the absence of light in a plant? Is there a relation with rhizodeposition?
