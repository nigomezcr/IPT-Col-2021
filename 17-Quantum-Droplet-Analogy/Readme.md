# Problem 17: Quantum Droplet Analogy

Small droplets on the surface of a liquid can exhibit quantum-like behavior in analogy with the so-called pilot wave theory. Construct an experiment to test as many quantum analogies as possible, and discuss the theoretical and experimental limitations of  this analogy.  Can the analogy be pushed to cover phenomena involving entanglement, such as Bell inequality violations? [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIyTZDHuarQ&feature=youtu.be)
