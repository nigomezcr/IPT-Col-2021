Welcome to our repository! Here you can find some of the work done in our way to compete in the *UN Physics Tournament*  (UNPT) 2020 edition, the internal physics competition of *Universidad Nacional de Colombia* (UNAL) located in Bogotá, Colombia. The UNPT purpose is to create a space to show the talent of students dealing with everyday physics problems, which require a broad range of skills to solve, including research abilities as well as  a strong teamwork component. Our team is formed by the following undergraduate physics students:

- Nicolás Gomez (**General**)

- Sebastian Ordoñez (**Lieutenant General**)
- Daniel Ortiz (**Major General**)
- Maria Paula Montes (**Brigadier General**)
- Juan Bernardo (**Lieutenant Colonel**)
- Juan Pablo (**Captain**)
- Arduino Uno (**Sargent**)

- Alejandra Alarcón(*Admiral*) --R.I.P.
- Lorena Bucuru (*Major*) --R.I.P.
- Andrés Moreno (*Officer cadet*) --R.I.P.

Each main folder in this repo is associated to one of the proposed problems and includes different kind of resources employed to solve them. Welcome to our journey!
